# App Icon Spec — BVC Hälsokort

## Concept
A warm, trustworthy icon that immediately communicates "child health" with a subtle Swedish feel.

## Primary Design
A simplified, friendly growth chart curve on a soft background — evoking the well-known tillväxtkurva that every Swedish parent recognizes. A small heart or child silhouette accent adds warmth.

## Colors
- **Background:** Soft gradient from warm sky blue (#6BB5E0) to light teal (#4DA8A0) — calming, gender-neutral, trustworthy, subtly echoes Swedish blue
- **Curve/icon elements:** White (#FFFFFF) — clean and legible at small sizes
- **Accent:** Warm yellow (#F5C542) — small heart or dot, adds friendliness and a hint of Swedish gold

## Shape & Composition
- Rounded rectangle (standard iOS icon mask)
- A single smooth upward growth curve (white, ~4pt stroke weight at 1024px) going from lower-left to upper-right
- A small filled heart or circle at the top end of the curve
- Optionally: 2–3 tiny horizontal grid lines (very subtle, 10% white opacity) to reinforce the "chart" feel
- Keep the design centered with generous padding (~15% margin)

## Constraints
- Must be instantly readable at 60×60 pt (iPhone home screen)
- No text in the icon — it won't be legible at small sizes
- No more than 3 colors total
- Avoid fine details, thin lines, or photographic elements
- Final deliverable: 1024×1024 px, PNG, no transparency, no rounded corners (iOS applies the mask)

## Mood
Warm, clean, professional but approachable. Think "modern healthcare app" not "clinical." A parent should feel good tapping this icon.
